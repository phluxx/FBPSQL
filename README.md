# FBPSQL  

Football Pool SQL backend. Listens on port 8080 by default.  

THIS NEEDS REFACTORING HOWEVER...  

If you're going to take it upon yourself to refactor this program, please provide full documentation as to how to use it properly.  

Submit a PR, and I will consider merging the changes.  

You should also consider submitting a PR for the frontend to use your changes to the backend.  

If you're not willing to do all of the above, I don't know what to tell you. I'm not spending hours trying to review your refactored code and learning how to use it.   

This is just for fun, anyways.
